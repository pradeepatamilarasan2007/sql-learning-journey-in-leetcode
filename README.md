 SQL-learning-journey-in-leetcode
 This repository contains my SQL practice work. I am practicing SQL through platforms like leetcode and hackerRank to strengthen my query-writing and problem-solving skills.
 What I am learning:
    SELECT,WHERE,ORDER BY,LIMIT,GROUP BY,HAVING, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS,and CASE Statements.
 Plan:
    Add more solved problems,
    And learn JOIN operations step by step.
